#This is currently an unfinished work in progress.
#For this project I worked with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store.
#The database has 11 tables with data related to artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, customers, and more.
#I came up with the following analysis questions and SQL. 

#What is the total company revenue?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total),1) AS 'revenue'
FROM chinook.Invoices;

#Show breakdown of revenue by country. 
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total),3) as revenue, billingcountry as country
FROM chinook.Invoices inv
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY revenue DESC;

#Show breakdown of revenue by city.
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total),3) as revenue, billingcity as city
FROM chinook.Invoices 
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY revenue DESC;

#Show breakdown of genre popularity on music playlists which are not grouped by genre alone. 
#1 - this being for the playlist titled Music:
SELECT COUNT(t.genreid), g.name
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.playlist_track pt
ON t.trackid = pt.trackid
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON t.genreid = g.genreid
WHERE Playlistid = '1'
GROUP BY t.genreid
ORDER BY COUNT(t.genreid) desc;

#Show breakdown of genre popularity on music playlists which are not grouped by genre alone. 
#2 - this being for the playlist titled 90s Music:
SELECT COUNT(g.name), g.name
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.playlist_track pt
ON t.trackid = pt.trackid
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON t.genreid = g.genreid
WHERE Playlistid = '5'
GROUP BY g.name
ORDER BY COUNT(g.name) desc;

#Show breakdown of genre popularity on music playlists which are not grouped by genre alone. 
#3 - this being for the playlist titled On-The-Go 1:
SELECT COUNT(g.name), g.name
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.playlist_track pt
ON t.trackid = pt.trackid
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON t.genreid = g.genreid
WHERE Playlistid = '18'
GROUP BY g.name
ORDER BY COUNT(g.name) desc;

#Which artists songs show up the most on playlists? List the top ten. 
SELECT COUNT(ar.name), ar.name
FROM chinook.artists ar 
  JOIN chinook.albums a
  ON ar.artistid = a.artistid
    JOIN chinook.tracks t
    ON t.albumid = a.albumid
      JOIN chinook.playlist_track pt
      ON pt.trackid = t.trackid
GROUP BY ar.name
ORDER BY COUNT(ar.name) desc
LIMIT 10;
