#This is currently an unfinished work in progress.
#For this project I worked with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store.
#The database has 11 tables with data related to artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, customers, and more.
#I came up with the following analysis questions and SQL. 

#What is the total company revenue?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total),1) AS 'revenue'
FROM chinook.Invoices;

#Show breakdown of revenue by country. 
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total),3) as revenue, billingcountry as country
FROM chinook.Invoices inv
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY revenue DESC;

#Show breakdown of revenue by city.
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total),3) as revenue, billingcity as city
FROM chinook.Invoices 
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
