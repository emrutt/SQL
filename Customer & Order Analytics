#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT Product, min(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT product, ROUND(sum(quantity)*price) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity)*price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
