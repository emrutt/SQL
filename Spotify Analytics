#For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
#Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
#Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#I found the top ten songs, showing the artist and scores in popularty, danceability, and energy.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity, danceability, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10
;

#Then I calculated the average danceability of the top 5 songs.
SELECT ROUND(SUM(danceability)/COUNT(track_name),2)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > '93'
;

#I determined which song was the longest, and how long it is.
SELECT MAX(duration_ms), track_name,
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
;

#Then I determined which song was the shortest, and how short it is. 
SELECT track_name, MIN(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
;

#Next, I found the average scores in danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, and liveness for all 50 tracks in the dataset.
SELECT AVG(danceability), AVG(energy), AVG(loudness), AVG(speechiness), AVG(acousticness), AVG(instrumentalness), AVG(liveness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
;

#Lastly, I wrote the following query to display stats on all the songs by Olivia Rodrigo that made this Top 50 list.
SELECT track_name, song_key, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'
;
